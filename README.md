# magenta (prototype branch)
a quick and bad prototype of the magenta programming language's basic functionality before i move on to implement everything properly

## language design
inspired by the bourne shell, f#, typescript, and go. it is strongly typed, immutable where possible, and aims to keep code as short as possible whilst maintaining readability and not being absolutely ridiculous

see `target.m`
